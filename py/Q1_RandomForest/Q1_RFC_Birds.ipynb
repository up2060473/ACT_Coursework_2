    "## Introduction\n",
    "Image classification is a common and very useful technique in computing, and this skill is becoming increasingly in demand. Whilst Convolutional Neural Networks are a popular choice for image classification, this notebook combined with ../Q2_CNN/Q2_CNN_Birds.ipynb will provides insights into both traditional methods and CNNs. Before we begin, below is a quick overview of the dataset we will be using and how we will build the Random Forest Classifier:\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest classifiers (RFCs) are a traditional Machine learning methods that identifies patterns in data by building many decision trees. Each tree infers the data and the model combines these to classify new unseen data. A classification tree splits data at each step by seperating the group by a certain feature. Each path from the root (top) to the leaf (bottom) represents rules used to classsify data. \n",
    "\n",
    "A useful thought experiment: Think about a room full of people. There is a flowchart that asks yes/no questoions - the first question is \"Do you have brown hair?\" - based on the answer you give, you are instructed to move to the left or to the right. There are now 2 groups, those with brown hair and those with not. Both groups now get asked further questions that split them up repeatidly until a certain criteria is met (eg how many people in a single group). This is similar to how RFCs work. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Dataset:\n",
    "- We will use the Birds classification dataset from Rahma Sleam, Kaggle. This will remain constant across Q1, Q2 and Q3. \n",
    "- There are 6 types of bird we need to predict, these are called \"classes\" or \"Targets\" as they are what we want to predict givien the features of an image.\n",
    "    - American Goldfinch\n",
    "    - Barn Owl\n",
    "    - Carmine Bee-Eater\n",
    "    - Downy Woodpecker\n",
    "    - Emperor Penguin\n",
    "    - Flamingo\n",
    "- All these birds have their own distinct features as they range over across a wide range of habitats - see link for more detail.\n",
    "- This will be very beneficial for our decision tree classifier. \n",
    "\n",
    "We Will:\n",
    "- Load an image dataset through extracting hog features\n",
    "- Explore how the dataset is distributed among each class (ie, how many images there are for each dataset)\n",
    "    - This will help us limit any biases\n",
    "- Perform Preprocessing\n",
    "- Split data into testing and training\n",
    "- Train a RFC\n",
    "- Evaluate its performance\n",

    "HOG focuses on Edges, Shapes and main silhouettes and largely ignores fine texture and color. It captures couarse texture but not fine-grain texture or spatial hierarchies. Therefore, the model performs better on classes that have very distinct features such as the Emperor Penguin. Classes with more subtle features can become confused, for example Barn Owls are often mistaken for Downy Woodpackers, suggesting that edge-based features alone are often insufficient for fine image classification. This is a key limitation for Random Forest Classifiers used with HOG extraction. \n",
    "\n",
    "This limitation is well documented alongside the fact that Random Forests do not learn hierarchial visual features. However, there is an alternative method - Convolutional Neural Networks, To view how we approach this, see notebook ../Q2_CNN/Q2_CNN_Birds.ipynb ."
